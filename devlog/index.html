                The 6502 is an amazing microproccesser that revolutionized the world of technology and changed the future
                forever. It kick started the development of home computers in the 80s and made computers easier to use and 
                understand. This dev-log is to document and share my own journey in making a home-brew 6502 computer. I will
                cover ever step I took when building this computer and all the mistakes and obstacles I had to face in hopes
                someone will find it interesting and even helpful. I was inspired by 
                <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater/featured">Ben Eater</a> and his Youtube videos where
                he himself makes a 6502 computer from scratch.
