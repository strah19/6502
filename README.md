# 6502

# Build
To run vasm, the command is `.\vasm6502_oldstyle.exe -Fbin -dotdir file.s -o objectname`

# Notes
The majority of the assemblt code would not work with the current computer because of the constant memory map changes.
However, the code can be updated or the memory map can be changed (since the hardware implementation uses a GAL).
